Ted audio Collective I'm elise hugh. It's ted Talks daily. Here's something really promising. We might be the first generation of humans to be truly sustainable. Environmental data scientist Hannah Ritchie says it's in the numbers. In her Ted 2020 Talk, she unpacks how the conventional notion of sustainability can be misleading and the opportunities for the environment that she sees in the data. Stick around after her talk, where Hannah will talk with me to expand on some of her big ideas after the break. It's become strangely normal to tell our kids that they're going to die from climate change. If sea level rise doesn't get them, then a wildfire will, or a global famine, or crop failures, maybe a fatal heat wave, the insect apocalypse or the fishless oceans. These are the headlines we've all been told will be the end of humanity. So we shouldn't be surprised then that young people today feel crippled with anxiety. A large international survey asked 10,000 young people about their attitudes to climate change. More than half said they think humanity is doomed. Three quarters find the future frightening, and more than one in three are hesitant to have children of their own. Young people today truly feel like they could be the last generation. In fact, prominent activist groups actually take on this very name. Now I get this feeling I've been there. I used to feel like humanity was doomed despite having multiple environmental degrees. Felt completely helpless to do anything about it. But I'm a data scientist, and after years poring over the data on how far humanity's come and how quickly things are now moving, my perspective on this has changed. I think we've got this framing upside down. Far from being the last generation, I think we've be the first generation. The first generation to be sustainable. Now, when we think about sustainability, we might imagine humans have only become unsustainable in the very recent past. Their ancestors lived in perfect balance of nature, and only recently has that been knocked off. Unfortunately, this is not true. If we're nostalgic for a sustainable past to rewind back to, there is none. The world has never been sustainable. Now, I get that's a controversial statement, so let me explain why, when we think about the definition of sustainability, we might imagine something like this it's having a low environmental impact to protect future generations. And it's true. By this definition, many of our ancestors were sustainable. They did have a low environmental impact. But the reason they had a low environmental impact is because the populations were tiny. And the reason their populations were tiny is because half of children died before reaching puberty. Half of children died. That then raises the question is that what we really think sustainability is? Is that the world we want to maintain and preserve? One where half of our children die? I hope your answer to that is no. If we care about human suffering, we need to add another dimension to this. We need to also provide a good life for everyone today. Now, that gives our definition two halves. If we fail on either half, we have failed to be sustainable. That's why our ancestors were never sustainable. They never achieved the first half of the equation. Now, over the last few centuries, the world has made amazing progress. On the first half, as we show in our rodent data, child mortality is now down to 4%. Extreme poverty used to be the default. Now, less than one in ten people live there. Literacy in education used to be rare. Now most children in the world get the opportunity to go to school. The world as it is today is still unacceptable. It's unacceptable that millions of children die every year. It's unacceptable that hundreds of millions live on less than $2 a day, which is an incredibly low poverty line. But pick almost any metric of human well being and you'll find that the world has become a much better place. But this progress has come at a cost. It has come at a cost to the environment. We burned wood and fossil fuels for energy. We expanded farmlands at the cost of forests. And our insatiable appetite for meat means you now use half of the world's habitat land for farming. We kill billions of animals every year. These are the trends that make us feel doomed. We see these lines rising and we assume that they might never stop. But more recent data tells us a slightly different story, a more hopeful story that we can turn things around. Over the last few decades, emissions in the UK have halved. That means that my carbon footprint today is less than half that of my grandparents when they were my age. That's despite the fact I live a much more stagnant lifestyle. Or as they'd put it, you youngsters just don't know how good you've got it these days. Now, you might think the UK is cheating here. It used to be this industrial powerhouse. Now it just gets China, India, Bangladesh to produce its stuff for it. Maybe it's just offshored all of these emissions. There's a bit of truth to this. When we adjust for trade, emissions in the UK are higher, but we still see this dramatic decline over the last few decades. Offshoring is a bit of the story, but it's not the entire story. At the same time, the UK has increased its GDP, GDP has gone up while emissions have come down. And it's not the only country to achieve this. Here we see the same for the US. For Germany, France, Spain, Portugal. A long list of countries have increased GDP while reducing their emissions. And again, this is not just because they've offshored them. The notion economic growth has to be incompatible with reducing our environmental impact is simply wrong. Now, rich countries are reducing their emissions, but low and middle income countries are increasing theirs. What does this mean at a global level? Well, total CO2 emissions are now beginning to flatline. But actually, emissions per person already peaked a decade ago. That means the emissions of the average person in the world today have peaked and are now falling. And we will see a peak in total CO2 emissions soon. Now, why is this happening? A big driver has been technological change. Here we see coal production in the UK since 1700. Now, the UK was the birthplace of industrial coal and it has now died there. When I was born, more than half of the UK's electricity was coming from coal. This is now less than 2%, and it's dying in many other countries too. Here you see the same for us. Germany, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Ireland. In many countries in the world, coal is dying. Taking its place are renewables, where costs are plummeting. The cost of solar has fallen by 90% in the last decade alone. And if you're worried that it looks like this price trend is leveling off, don't be. When we zoom in, we see that the price of solar continues to fall. Now, the same is true for wind. Go back a decade and solar and wind were among most expensive energy technologies we had. That is why the world is not making progress. That is why countries were not deploying them. They were far too expensive. But just ten years on, and that script has flipped in many countries in the world, solar and wind are now the cheapest. Now, if we're going to have renewables, we're going to need energy storage. But there's good news there, too. The price of batteries has fallen by 98% since 1990. If you take the battery you'd find in a Tesla today, go back to 1990, it would have cost $1 million. It now costs just 12,000. That's completely transformed the world of energy storage and completely transformed the world of transport. Global sales of petrol and diesel cars have already peaked. They peaked in 2017 and they are now falling. Taking their place are electric cars. When the space of just a few years sales are going through the roof. Now, from energy and transport to the food we eat, you might imagine that global deforestation is at its highest level ever. But actually, global deforestation peaked decades ago and is now falling. But actually it's better than that, because many countries are now regrowing their old forests, such as the net decline is even more impressive. Now, why is this happening? A big driver has been an increase in crop yields. For all of our agricultural history, crop yields were low and stagnant. Farmers had basically no opportunities to increase them. Over the last century, across many countries and many different crop types, crop yields have skyrocketed. Now, what this means is that we can grow a lot more food from a lot less land. Amount of land used to produce corn in the US has not increased in over a century. But look at the change in corn production. My main point here is that in the past, human progress had to come at the cost of the environment. If we wanted energy, we had to burn wood or we had to burn fossil fuels. We wanted to grow more food, we had to expand farmlands, often at the costs of forests. But technology and innovation means we're very quickly decoupling these impacts. Such as this conflict is no longer true. Let's then think about the world that we can have. We need to achieve the first half of our equation. We need to end global poverty. And here, I'm not talking about raising everyone above A-2-A day poverty line. That is simply not good enough. We need to provide everyone with a good, comfortable life. No child should die from a cause that's preventable. Every child should get the opportunity to go to school and get an education. At the same time, we need to peak and reduce our CO2 emissions. We need to move away from fossil fuels, and we need to end deforestation while feeding 8910 Boeing people at the same time. How do we do that? How do we become the first generation? First, our low karma technologies need to become the default. There's two ways to do this. The first is to make sure that they are affordable, to make sure that they are the cheapest option. Solar and wind are already cheaper than coal. Electric cars will soon be cheaper than gasoline, and alternative proteins need to be cheaper than meat. The other way to do this is to make sure that these technologies are better. Environmental products have often been promoted as this hippie gimmick, but they need to go mainstream. And for that, they need to be better than the high carbon alternatives. Now, my brother recently got an electric car. He didn't get an electric car because he really, really cares about the environment. He does not want to be the next Greta Thunberg, and he definitely does not want to be like me. He got an electric car because the design and the driving experience were far better than the petrol alternatives. That is how we make low carbon technologies the default. We need to Reframe the way we talk about sustainability, it's often promoted as a sacrifice. Environmental messaging is often built on scarcity, but reducing our lives back to the bare minimum and no more. But this is not a vision that inspires anyone. This is not the future we want to build. We need to reframe sustainability as an opportunity because it is an opportunity. It's an opportunity to provide clean, abundant energy for everyone, whether that's powering cities or countries or getting rural communities connected for the very first time. It's about not being at the whims of fossil fuel markets or having millions plunge into fuel poverty when dictators invade neighboring countries. Stopping people from dying is not a sacrifice. Finally, it's a way to rethink the way we live our life, the way we design our cities and our communities. He was e Copenhagen, where bikes roll the road, or Amsterdam, where you have layer upon layer of bike track. Now, I'm not saying this is how our cities have to look. We can design them in any way we want. What I'm saying is that sustainability gives us the shove to rethink the way we do things. Finally, we need to rethink the way we use data. As a data scientist, I take this very seriously. Now, environmentalists have done an amazing job of waking the world up to these problems. Those charts of rising CO2 and rising temperature have been absolutely critical. They're why I'm on this stage today. They're why I got involved in this in the first place. But there's a limit when that's all we see. We become paralyzed. We see these lines rising and we assume that they might never stop. We assume that no progress has been made, that nothing good is happening. But as we've just seen, this couldn't be further from the truth. We need to use data to inspire, to show what the problems are, but also what the solutions are. And we need to show real signs of progress from countries, individuals, companies. Historically, our sustainability equation went like this. It was providing a good life for everyone today, or having a low environmental impact to preserve opportunities for future generations. It was one or the other. You could not have both at the same time. We can be the first generation that does achieve both. Now, the emphasis here is on can. None of this is inevitable. In fact, it's not even inevitable that we have this opportunity in the first place. We're only here because of the relentless work of environmentalists activists, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, communicators, determined to make the world a better place. They have brought us here and we need to take that forward. We need to do it bigger and we need to do it much, much faster. But we do have the opportunity to be the first generation that builds a sustainable world. Let's take it. Thank you. When you say we can be the generation that can achieve both, what is that vision? That vision is one achieving the first half of occasion, so providing a good life for everyone today. So we've made amazing progress over the last few centuries, and the world today is still not good enough. We still have poverty, we still have health problems, education problems, but we've made amazing progress and we can continue that progress if we want to, so we can achieve the first half. And what's changed is that we now have the potential to achieve the second half. Technologies and innovation means we now have the potential for clean energy, so we don't need to use fossil fuels or forests. We've got high tech agriculture, so we don't need to turn the whole planet into a farmland to grow our food. So technological change is also going to let us achieve the second half so we can have a good life for everyone today. And technological change means we can do that in a clean way that protects future generations. You've been watching and really digging into data for the duration of your career. Is there any data that you've seen on the trends, the macro trends that are happening now that has really surprised you? I think it's really about the pace of change. So when we're talking about environmental change and these technologies, when we're talking about solar or wind or batteries or electric vehicles, it's the rate of change that we've seen recently. So if you look at a timeline, if even you go back five or ten years, if you're looking at that data to understand these problems, to date, you're like way out of date. Even a few years and you're out of date. So if you look, for example, at electric vehicles, you'll see basically a completely flat line. Like, no one's buying them, they're too expensive. And then a space of just like one, two, three years, it goes boom, boom, boom. Like, really, really this really, really fast growth rate. And it's the same for solar or wind. So I think it's really about the pace of change that make me very, very optimistic. Is the transition happening, I guess urgently enough? Because we are still seeing so many poorer countries or massive industrial countries like China continue to rely on fossil fuels. And we are in this larger energy transition that is much talked about. But often the pessimistic take is that it's not happening at the rate that we're going to need to change over when it comes to our energy sources. Yeah. So I'm pretty optimistic on these, but I also want to make very clear that it's not happening fast enough. We have the opportunity to do this, but we need to do more and we need to do it much, much faster. I think when it comes to optimism on these issues, I like to look at it in two ways. So you can be a kind of unchangeable or complacent optimist, where you assume, yeah, everything's fine, it's just going to continue. That's definitely not my position, not where I stand. I would frame myself as a changeable optimist or an impatient optimist, where I see the potential that we can really do this, but we need to accelerate and we need to take action. What's the top opportunity or opportunities that you see emerge from the data? I think it's about the really rapidly falling costs of solar, wind, all of these technologies where we're not just opening up the potential to decarbonize our energy systems and tackle climate change, but we're really transforming the whole development pathway for the world. So in poorer countries, it's not just about mitigating climate change, it's about providing really clean, scalable energy for people in a much, much cheaper way, and the same for food. If we can get agricultural technologies really, really cheap, we can feed everyone in a much more cleaner and affordable way. So I think it's really about the cost and what that opened up, not just for climate change, but development, which was the first half of the equation of building a good life for everyone. What countries and what have you seen in different countries have been really leaders in setting examples for you in terms of ways that we can decouple CO2 emissions from GDP, which is what you discussed, right? When we look at which countries have decoupled GDP growth from CO2 emissions growth, it's mainly the rich countries. And that's because we would see it from a development pathway point of view of rich countries. In the past, like way in the past, they developed on fossil fuels and they burned loads of fossil fuels to do that. Then they reached a point where they had the wealth to invest in these cleaner technologies. So that's why they are now seeing this decline. The hope is that we can shift that price trend even further such that we're opening up this clean pathway for the entire world. So lower income countries don't need to go through the pathway that the UK did, for example, because we just can't do that because the starting point is so much more advanced, so much more advanced. So I think those are rich countries at the moment that we're seeing it's decoupling. But we'd really hope that that would then shift towards middle income countries and low income countries as well. Okay, and then are there any other cool, low carbon technologies that are really exciting you right now? I think a big area for me is food. I think people underestimate the environmental impact of food when we look at deforestation, biodiversity loss, even climate change. Yeah, I think for me, food really sits at the heart of all of those technologies. Some of the basic ones are just what we now take for granted is the increases in crop yields. But I think there there's still loads of potential. But then I think there for me, the most emergent ones are rethinking the way we talk about meat, and we scale meat. Say more about that. What do you mean? Specifically, cattle production, but also other forms of meat is like the leading driver of deforestation, arguably one of the leading drivers of biodiversity loss. We use half of the world's habitable land for farming, and three quarters of that is for livestock. So just so much of the world's land is used to provide livestock. It's actually a really inefficient way of producing food. So there in technologies, there's just ways that we can do that. We're already seeing loads in the alternative protein space, but the hope would be that you could basically recreate exactly like, for like a burger in a lab or chicken. We've seen Ted talks about that. Yeah. So I think there's just loads of potential. Okay. All right. Before we let you go, the big idea, of course, of your work is that we sort of reframe sustainability, not as sacrifice, but as opportunity. Talk a little bit more about that and why that means a more sustainable future for the rest of us. So I think the way, often environmental messaging in the past has been about sacrifice. It's about drawing their lives back to the bare minimum, for sure. And I think a lot of the aim of drivers of change there has been shame, so it's almost been shaming people into action. So if you're not taking action, it's because you don't care about people or you don't care about the environment. I think that's been tried and tested and it just doesn't work right. I think we need to create a new vision that excites people to change or offers them, even if they don't care about climate or the environment, if they then make the right decision that leads to a low carbon choice, then that's with EVs. Right? Right, exactly. Yeah. The example I use in my talk was my brother getting an EV. He didn't do that because he really wants to cut his carbon emissions. He just really thinks the technology is cool and that's fine. He's reduced his carbon footprint and that's fine. And if he gets there by a different message, then that's absolutely fine. So I think we need to reframe. We talk about it, because the way we've been doing it so far is just not working. Okay, hannah, thank you so much. Thank you. P-R-X.
